## Installing MongoDb and Postgres

Get a cloud instance of mongo from the web
create a database and add password authentication 
add ip address 0.0.0.0/0 so that it is accessible from everywhere. if you set it to your own ip address then only your computer will be able to access it
Click on connect then Compass. install compass locally for GUI interface of your database

For postgres, simply go to neon.tech and create a database and keep the connection string handy
