## Types of Memory

In JVM, There exists a **STACK** and a **HEAP**.
The stack follows the Last In, First Out concept. all the local variables inside a method are stored here. (arguments)
the variable instances are stored in heap
each class instance created has its own address through which it is linked with the stack.
