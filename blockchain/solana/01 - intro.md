# Consensus Mechanism
Solana uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH), combined with Proof of Stake (PoS). Proof of History provides a verifiable and sequential timestamp for each transaction, ensuring the order of events without the need for extensive computational work. This helps Solana achieve high throughput and fast confirmation times.

The PoS mechanism in Solana is like a team sport where validators are incentivized to work together to keep the network secure. Validators stake their own SOL tokens and are rewarded for following the rules and penalized for misbehavior. This creates a more sustainable and cost-effective system, with fewer barriers to entry compared to traditional Proof of Work mechanisms.

Solana's innovative consensus mechanism allows for incredibly fast transaction processing and low fees. It enables thousands of transactions to be processed per second, making it ideal for decentralized applications, financial services, and even gaming platforms. Solana's efficiency and scalability make it stand out among other blockchain platforms.

By utilizing this unique combination of consensus mechanisms, Solana is creating a system where everyone can play nicely together, creating a more collaborative and efficient future for blockchain technology. Solana's commitment to innovation and scalability sets it apart as a powerful platform for building decentralized applications and driving the adoption of blockchain technology.

# Why Solana?
1. **Scalability**: Solana offers high scalability, processing thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for applications requiring fast transaction processing. At its peak, it can handle 50k - 65k transactions per second. *Theoretically* according to its whitepaper it should potentially be able to handle *710,000* tx per second.
2. **Low Transaction Fees:** Solana's scalability is accompanied by low transaction fees, providing affordable access to the network for users. Good for micro-transactions. While on the other hand, ETH Network has about 20$ to a whopping 100$ transaction fees on a congested network.
3. **Developer-Friendly Environment:** Solana provides comprehensive tools, libraries, and documentation, enabling developers to easily build decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
4. **Robust Infrastructure:** Solana's secure and reliable infrastructure ensures stability and availability for applications, reducing the risk of downtime.

These benefits make Solana an attractive platform for developers and users alike, enabling the creation of scalable applications with low fees and offering a supportive and vibrant community.
**I personally use Solana as well.**


# Facts
- The system may performÂ **micropayments of fractional SOLs**, which are called **Lamports**. They are named in honor of Solana's biggest technical influence, Leslie Lamport. A lamport has a value of 0.000000001 SOL.
